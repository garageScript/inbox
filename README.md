# What is this app for?

Inbox is an email client. With Inbox, you can have `infinite` number of email accounts without having to sign up for each account. It's useful when you want to make sure your emails never get mixed up. Labeling emails is not necessary because they already come into different accounts.

Try Inbox by setting it up in your server.
